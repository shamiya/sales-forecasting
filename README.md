# Sales Analysis and Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data to identify trends and forecast future sales using Python. The dataset contains yearly sales data, including profit centers, product groups, general ledger names, regions, and countries. Various visualizations and predictive analysis techniques are applied to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

## 📊 Data Analysis and Visualizations
### 1️⃣ **Year-wise Sales Graph**
- Visualizes total sales for each fiscal year.
- Helps identify trends in revenue growth or decline over time.

### 2️⃣ **Yearly Quantity-wise Sales**
- Displays the total quantity of products sold per year.
- Useful for understanding demand patterns.

### 3️⃣ **Region-wise Sales**
- Compares sales performance across different regions.
- Helps identify high-performing and low-performing regions.

### 4️⃣ **Country-wise Sales**
- Breaks down sales figures by country.
- Useful for evaluating market penetration and country-wise revenue contribution.

### 5️⃣ **Sales Trends**
- Identifies patterns in sales over multiple years.
- Helps in making strategic business decisions.

### 6️⃣ **Sales Heatmap**
- A heatmap visualization to show correlations between different sales parameters.
- Helps in finding key drivers of sales performance.

### 7️⃣ **Sales Forecast**
- Uses ARIMA time series forecasting to predict future sales.
- Provides a data-driven approach for sales planning.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for analysis
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
